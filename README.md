CHANGELOG: 
Added ability to edit the Background Vow.
Added Asset track to character sheet Assets.
Relocated Asset track to inside the header button so the current Health value could be seen without entering the Asset details.
Fixed a bug where positive Momentum was cancelling the roll for the results on positive matches.
