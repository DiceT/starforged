- Changed font color of Macro textbox to ff6666
- Changed background of module list in order to see the text better (was unable to change font color).


CHANGELOG 0.15
- Added ability to edit the Background Vow.
- Added Asset track to character sheet Assets.
- Relocated Asset track to inside the header button so the current Health value could be seen without entering the Asset details.
