v0.2.01
 - Fixed 2 Character tables which did not have the table descriptions.
 - Added functionality to import Moves from Datasworn (official Starforged text). This populates the Compendium with the most up-to-date data. Currently, existing characters will not be updated with the most current moves (requires a new character).
 - Fixed an issue where the Challenges were not displaying the proper hexes based upon difficulty of the Challenge when editing it.
 

v0.2.00
- Fixed the Action + Theme and Descriptor + Focus table rollers on the full character sheet as well as the dashboard.
- STATISTICS header is now a button that will clear statistics.
- Added TOOLS tab to the main character sheet to have access to all generator tools from one character sheet.
- All actors, with the exception of creatures, are now generated to link their data to the token. This means that when you activate the location sheet via the token, the original in the actor list is also updated.
- Planets and Settlements will have their names displayed automatically when generated.
- Fixed the macro template so you can enter in the name of a folder or the name of a specific table.
- Added default macros for several tables that don't have direct links within the system: Confront Chaos, Endure Harm, Endure Stress, Make a Discovery, Take Decisive Action, Withstand Damage.

v0.18
THIS UPDATE REQUIRES ALL OF THE TABLES TO BE REINSTALLED
: Please DELETE ALL on your Starforged folders in the tables section (right click the folder --> Delete All --> Yes ). Then REFRESH (F5).

v0.15
- Added ability to edit the Background Vow.
