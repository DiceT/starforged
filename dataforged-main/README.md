# Dataforged

Official *Ironsworn: Starforged* rules data in JSON, for use in community tools.

## Intent

This repository is intended to give [*Starforged*'s kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shawntomkin/ironsworn-starforged) backers access to game data to incorporate into their own *Starforged* tools; it has been left public in the interest of keeping it easily accessible (and, frankly, will be of limited use without the complete text of the Backer Preview).

## Licensing

*Starforged* is currently under development, and this content is not yet licensed for non-personal use without explicit permission of [Shawn Tomkin](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/). Once *Starforged*'s development is complete and it is released, a permissive Creative Commons license for non-commercial and commercial projects will be attached to this content.

In other words: for the moment, treat it like you would excerpts from a copyrighted work; please include attribution (e.g. "Copyright Â©2021 Shawn Tomkin and Absolute Tabletop, LLC") and a link back to the repository in your project... and drop a link in the [Ironsworn discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/6QMvmJb), because we're excited to see what you make with it!

## Recommended Usage

Due to this being preview content, this repo is fairly unstable! As the game grows and evolves, I will almost certainly make changes in how it's organized. I recommend forking or otherwise copying this repo's contents rather than pulling from it directly.
